# Spring-Library-Project
Spring Boot API for a Library

## Why are we doing this?
To demonstrate an understanding of everything learnt over the past nine weeks including:
- the use of Jira to track a project using Agile scrum methods.
- the planning of a project, making use of MoSCoW prioritisation, story points, user stories, risk assessments etc.
- a demonstration of an understanding of Git as a version control system and the feature branch model.
- showing an understanding of Java through the building of an application with CRUD functionality.
- showing an understanding of relational databases as data must be persisted to one.
