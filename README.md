# Spring-Library-Project
Spring Boot API for a Library

## Why are we doing this?
To demonstrate an understanding of everything learnt over the past nine weeks including:
- the use of Jira to track a project using Agile scrum methods.
- the planning of a project, making use of MoSCoW prioritisation, story points, user stories, risk assessments etc.
- a demonstration of an understanding of Git as a version control system and the feature branch model.
- showing an understanding of Java through the building of an application with CRUD functionality.
- showing an understanding of relational databases as data must be persisted to one.

## How I expected the challenge to go
In the beginning of the challenge I expected to be able to completed the basic CRUD functionality as I had a good understand of it already. I expected to have more than enough time to finish the basics and also enough time to attempt to implement some custom queries but not enough time to expand the project even further, for example implementing a table for library members. I was able to confirm this during my planning process which meant that I was in a position not to start something I couldn't finish before the project due date.

I found the planning process more useful that expected as it ultimately sped up the production process. Although I found assigning story points a little difficult without having other people working on the project to discuss it with. 

I was also expecting to struggle a little with using Git, particularly when it comes to merging branches as this will be the first time using the feature branch model for a project.
